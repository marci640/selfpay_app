    <p> RE: Medical Debt Discount Request </p>

    <p> To whom it may concern, </p>

    <p> This letter is a formal request for an itemized statement. I recently received a bill from your facility; however, I will require an itemized billing statement (including CPT codes) before submitting a payment.  
    </p>

    <p> Sincerely, </p>
